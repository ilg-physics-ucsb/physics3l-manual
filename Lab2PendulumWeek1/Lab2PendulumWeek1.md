# Lab 2 Pendulum Week 1

Lab 2: Pendulum Week 1

Required Materials:
String, twine, or some other type of long, thin, flexible structure for tying and supporting
A pair of scissors 
A cylindrical beam or similar geometrical shape (or tape it)
phyphox "Acceleration without g” or a stopwatch (or work with someone with phyphox)
Suggested Additional Materials:
A paper or cardboard tube like that found in a roll of toilet paper
A rubber band or some other elastic material  
Lab Goals:
Construct an apparatus
[INSERT ANIMATED GIF HERE]
While you may be able to achieve a pendulum without it, we recommend you find a tube from toilet paper and, after flattening it, mark the width of your phone on both sides of the flatted tube.
Cut into the roll approximately 2cm deep at each mark of your phone’s width and then cut along the length of the roll to complete the cutout. Do this on both sides.
Poke holes in each of the corners of the now flattened roll, leaving enough space along the edge that you don’t rip out to the edge.

Data Analysis
Understand the theory of Simple Harmonic Motion
Understand the relationship between period and length
Develop the equations from Newton's equations of motion to verify your data
Use the chart function in Google Sheets to plot data and use that data to corroborate your equations






Part I: Pendulum & Simple Harmonic Motion (or harmonic oscillations?)
In previous courses, you probably learned about simple harmonic motion 
An ideal simple pendulum is one in which there is a point mass suspended from some pivot point by massless string

As long as we keep our initial angle small, we can use the small angle approximation as long as we keep it under 15 degrees
We will now investigate _____

Background
A period is the time from one maxima point to the other and back again
Omega is traditionally used as a substitution in the solution to the differential equation for simple harmonic oscillation and it shows that the second derivative of a thing is proportional to that thing
Period is proportional to the sqrt of the length of the pendulum divided by gravity (which is just proportional to the length of the pendulum?)
The restoring forces obey Hooke’s Law (approx). The restoring forces are proportional to the displacements.
PAULA’S SLIDES

Ex 1 Derive the equations
Ex 1
Assume θ = θₒ cos(ωt)
Assuming your phone face always points at the pivot point--this allows us to convert to polar coordinates--determine the equation for the acceleration in the radial direction and the equation of the acceleration in the angular direction (assuming theta = theta not….)
Recall a_r is ____ and a_theta is ____
Plug in the formula for theta
Assuming your phone face is pointed in the z ^hat, we only need to consider the y^hat (theta hat) and Z^hat directions for acceleration. One of these will follow the length of your phone and the other will follow the width of your phone.
Knowing the positional equation for both x and y, determine the first and second derivative of each.
Note: picture of phone at several different (3) positions with coordinates drawn on picture
Q1 Compare/Draw the conclusion that the period of one acceleration is the same as the period of the pendulum and that one period of one acceleration is double the first? “What is the period compared to…”

Ex 2
Show that we can assume a point mass for your phone, making our work much easier
Zak’s overleaf
Give them equation w = sqrt (mgL/I) (equation 1)
Do MoI of point particle
Determine MoI for phone using Parallel Axis Theorem
Plug PAT MoI into equation 1
Convince students that 1/12 Ma^2 where a is length of phone is much less than ML^2 and can be ignored (we might need to guide them through this)
Q2:
We want to make the correction term (the term due to rotation) as small as possible so given that your phone is X cm long, what length of string would you like to make your pendulum?

Build apparatus. Take pic. Take data.
