Theory


We will investigate resonance in an air column as we look to calculate the speed of sound.

Sound is caused by a disturbance in the surrounding medium—air. Air is an elastic medium, meaning it returns to its original shape once an acting force no longer acts. To illustrate ‘this’, consider a single audio speaker. When music is playing the speaker vibrates, pushing and pulling air molecules surrounding it. 



When the speaker moves outward, it pushes out surrounding air molecules and that push causes a chain reaction of disturbances that propagate through the air. <<figure 1>> When the speaker moves inward, it creates more space for air particles to move, starting with the air molecules closest to the speaker. <<figure 2>> This is known as positive and negative displacement.

Remember, the air particles themselves don’t move, they only vibrate. Check out figure X to see how the individual particles only displace and return to their equilibrium.




This vibration produces acoustic waves. Acoustic waves are the propagation of energy through the pressure field by means of compression and decompression. When an acoustic wave is between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (more on this later), we call it sound. Sound can be looked at as small displacements of the medium or as pressure disturbances. To be overly simplistic, there are two elements at the point of reception (your ears) that form all sound waves—pressure and time. 


There are two main types of waves—transverse and longitudinal. 



Transverse waves oscillate in a motion perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. 
Consider a string where you move your hand up and down (or left and right); a wave is created that travels the length of the string. 



In contrast to transverse waves are longitudinal waves. Longitudinal waves oscillate in the same direction as the propagation of the wave. Sound waves fall into the latter category.



Sound waves make air molecules travel toward and away from the source in pockets of high and low pressure; they don’t bounce up and down. However, sound waves are often easier to visualize as a wavy line with peaks and troughs representing high and low pressure areas.
<<<<3L lab manual talks about compression, high pressure, low pressure. Needed? 4th paragraph from bottom of page 30. It would go here if so.>>>

If we drive a sine wave through our speaker then the propagating wave will be sinusoidal in shape. A sine wave is the simplest periodic vibration. Looking at a sine wave, we can label the various parts. From equilibrium, a peak is in the positive direction and is called a crest. In the negative direction, a trough is the bottom of a wave. Wavelength refers to the distance between crests or troughs. 

Remove one of the diagrams.


The upper part of the sine wave is the speaker moving forward producing the compression of air particles. The crest is the top of the wave. The lower part of the sine wave is the speaker moving rearward producing the stretching (rarefaction) of the air. The trough is the bottom of the wave. In the audio industry, a compression (push) wave is defined as positive.

Multiple waves in the same system will superimpose to form one unified wave. This is called the superposition principle. The brain perceives two notes, a low and a high note. In reality, it is one complex wave containing both slow and fast vibrations that reaches your ear when both notes are played together.


RT

In the pendulum lab, we looked at periodicity. The period was said to be the time it takes for one cycle in a repeating event or the time for which the event repeats itself. Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. Frequency is measured in units of hertz, Hz. One hertz means there was one occurrence of a repeating event per second.

Frequency is inversely proportional to period. In the pendulum lab, for example, I averaged data and found the period of my pendulum to be 1.78 s. This means that the frequency of my pendulum was 0.56 Hz (make better numbers).

The speed of sound is dependent on the medium through which it propagates and is a fundamental property of that medium. ...density of the medium through which it propagates as well as the “springiness” of the particle interactions.

All things being equal, sound will travel slower in denser materials and faster in “springier” ones.

Now we can look at the frequency of the vibration of our speaker, in which the frequency of a wave is the number of complete back-and-forth vibrations of a particular per unit time. If a particle of air undergoes 1600 longitudinal vibrations in 2 seconds then the frequency of the wave would be 800 vibrations per second. The unit used for frequency is the Hertz (Hz), where

1 Hertz = 1 vibration / second

Each particle vibrates due to the motion of its nearest neighbor. For example, if the first particle in the medium begins vibrating at 500 Hz, it will push and pull on the next adjacent particle at the same frequency of 500 Hz. The process continues throughout the medium; each particle vibrates at the same frequency.


Boundary Conditions 

Waves have certain 'interactions' at boundaries, making boundary conditions interesting and enlightening.

There exists two types of boundaries—fixed and free. A fixed boundary would be exemplified as a string attached to a wall. With sound waves, a fixed boundary is a position in which the sound wave interacts with something outside the medium. A free end is one in which the interacting end is not fixed but allows movement. <<<MORE>>>

When a sound wave reflects off a boundary it travels back in the direction it came, though inverted. It should be noted that the inversion is caused by the hardness of the material. Some materials do not cause the wave to invert upon reflection.




When an acoustic wave propagates outward, reflects, and travels back towards the source, there are two possibilities that can occur. At some distance d from the source, a crest and a trough meet. They essentially 'cancel' each other out. These waves are 90$\degree$ out of phase. This is known as destructive interference.


At some distance d from the source, a crest and a crest meet. They build each other up, constructively. This is known as constructive interference. <<More on phase?>> At some distance d from the source, a trough and a trough meet. They build (though inversely) each other down. This is also constructive interference. Note: after the waves interact with one another, they will continue to propagate as they were.




Speed of Sound

The speed of sound is a slightly tricky concept. It does not refer to how fast any one given particle is moving. Rather, it refers to how fast the sound wave propagates through the medium. If you were to pick a point on the wave, say one of the negative displacements, and watch it move...this would be the speed of sound. It is the measure of how fast the disturbance moves through a medium. Like a projectile, it is expressed in units of meters per second.

The speed of sound results from the inertia and elastic properties of the material it travels through. The greater the mass of individual particles of the medium, the less responsive they will be to the interactions between neighboring particles and the slower the wave. A sound wave will travel faster in a less dense material than a more dense material. For instance, a sound wave will travel nearly three times faster in Helium as it will in air. A sound wave will travel faster in a medium with more restoring force. Sound (technically acoustic) waves travel extremely fast in metals which have stiff crystal structures to restore individual particles.

Sound waves propagate at velocity v. The speed of propagation is determined by the medium through which the wave propagates.

The speed of sound in air can be expressed by the following equation:

v = 331 m/s + (0.6 m/s/C) * T

where T is the temperature of the air in degrees Celsuis.

Think about the case of a simple transverse wave; it takes the form of a sine wave as a function of distance. The wave has properties like amplitude, wavelength and distance. 

Looking at a sine wave as a function of time, period takes the place of wavelength when discussing peak to peak of a wave.

Resonance

The word resonance comes from latin words for ‘echo’ and ‘resound’. Resonance is illustrated by swing on a playground; if you push a friend on the swing and wait for it to return to you, the swing will fall into a rhythm, a natural interval. As long as you push the swing in time with its natural frequency, the swing can go higher. The natural frequency is the frequency at which it would oscillate if there were no resistive forces present. However, if you attempt to push the swing outside of this natural frequency, the swing will go lower (and you might hurt yourself).

The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental frequency, or the 1st harmonic. A harmonic is a positive integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. Open cylindrical air columns can produce all harmonics of the fundamental frequency. Cylinders with one closed end can only produce odd harmonic frequencies.

Amplitude is proportional to the driving force. 

Though we are not considering factors of a system, such as damping, we can investigate how resonance works. Looking at the real part of the particular solution to the differential equation for the equation of motion of the driving force, we find that

A2= f02(02 -  )2 + 422


which shows that the amplitude is proportional to the driving force. It also shows that left to its own devices, an oscillator vibrates at its natural frequency 0(or a slightly lower frequency 1 if we allow for the damping, ). If we try and force it to vibrate at a frequency , then for values of  close to 0, the oscillator responds very well, but if  is far from 0, it hardly responds at all.
