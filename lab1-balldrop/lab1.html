<h1>Part I: Kinematics, Collision and Energy Loss</h1>
<p>You have likely mastered the basic kinematic relations that govern projectile motion and collisions in previous introductory physics courses. In this intro lab, we will now investigate inelastic collisions, and energy loss to the environment.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>When you drop a ball from rest, you can easily calculate its height over time until it hits the floor: the usual routine of applying Newton's equations for constant acceleration will give you a fairly accurate account of the ball's trajectory. Once the ball hits the floor, however, it loses some amount of its total energy. This is evidenced by the fact that the ball will not bounce for the rest of eternity --- its successive heights quickly decline until it comes to rest.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>With this phenomena in mind, we can now ask about how to characterize this energy loss, if we can predict the successive bounce heights, and what the mathematical description of this kind of motion looks like. Can we develop equations which will be predictive, i.e. precise and accurate?</p>
<h4></h4>
<div class="QuestionHeading"><p>Question 1</p><div class="Question parsed"><p>(a) You drop a 0.1 kg ball from a height of 1m. Derive the equation that gives the ball's height over time, until it hits the floor. </p><p>(b) Derive two equations that give the ball's kinetic and potential energy as a function of height.</p><p>(c) What is the ball's total energy? Its potential energy at its maximum height? Its kinetic energy at the point of impact?</p></div></div>
<h4></h4>
<h2>1. The Coefficient of Restitution</h2>
<p>When a ball bounces, and hence loses energy, your first observation may be that the speed of the ball is reduced. This observation is what led Newton to propose "Newton's Experimental Law", which is now characterized by a quantity known as the coefficient of restitution. </p>
<h4></h4>
<p>Newton's Experimental Law states the following:  given a pair of bodies in collision, the ratio of final relative speed to initial relative speed is always the same.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>In our ball drop experiment, one of these bodies is "Earth" and the other is our ball. Since we are naturally measuring our ball's velocity with respect to Earth (with the Earth's velocity change due to a tennis ball being negligible, of course!), we obtain the following mathematical sentence:</p>

<h1>Part II: Experiment</h1>
<h2>1. Overview and Pre-lab</h2>
<p>Our job in this lab will be to verify Newton's Experimental Law, calculate <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">ϵ</span></span></span></span></span> for different balls, hypothesize what affects this constant, and use our results to make &#x26; test a prediction. While your first instinct may be to make a video recording of a ball bouncing, we will approach these tasks in a, perhaps, unexpected way: we will instead use only the sound of the the ball hitting the floor to make our measurements.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>The reason for doing this is quite simple: sound data are "cheap" and easy to analyze. Unlike video, which requires an immense increase in pixels (and thus data) in order to improve sampling rate &#x26; accuracy, sound data is one dimensional, letting us have a suitably fast sampling rate to make precise measurements. In this experiment, we really only need a few numbers: the times that the ball hits the ground-- we can calculate all other quantities of interest from this. Sound is more than adequate for this task, and video would waste resources on capturing information about the entire environment, colors, lighting etc., which we will ultimately toss out.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>This kind of thinking is actually critical to real experimental physics: often experiments are limited by data quality and equipment costs, so a bit of creative problem solving goes a long way in a real lab! Only measure what you need to!</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>Before moving on to the procedure, be sure that you have downloaded and installed the Phyphox app on your phone, and that you can use and access the "Acoustic Stopwatch" module. This module conveniently reports the time between "loud" sounds, so you don't even have to look at the graphs yourself. </p>
<h4></h4>
<p>Note that there is an "Inelastic Collision" experiment module bundled with Phyphox, but it doesn't give you all the data needed for this lab, and our testing has suggested it is <em>less</em> accurate than the procedure given below. In other words, don't use it :)</p>
<h2>2. Using sound to measure the coefficient of restitution</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Materials needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two kinds of bouncy balls</li>
<li>A hard, flat surface in an open space</li>
<li>Phyphox "Acoustic Stopwatch" or an audio recording device that shows sound amplitude</li>
</ul>

<div class="ExerciseHeading"><p>Exercise 1</p><div class="Exercise parsed"><p>After you have downloaded and installed phyphox, and have gathered your materials, follow the steps below to perform your experiment and collect data:</p><ol>
<li>Open up your acoustic timer in "sequence mode". This mode will record the times between 5 successive sounds.</li>
<li>In your large, open area, place your phone on the ground with the mic pointing down. For example, to accomplish this, I propped my phone up against the wall of my living room. </li>
<li>Hold the ball at the height of a nearby marker, such as a doorknob. It is not very important that the height is equal each run, but its nice for your data to be similar.</li>
<li>Press "Reset" on the app to clear any accidental data</li>
<li>Drop the ball and let 5 times register. If your ball knocks into an object or travels too far away, you will have to redo that run. Be sure to double check your times and make sure they are monotonically decreasing</li>
<li>Record these times somewhere, and repeat the procedure for each ball at least 5 times.</li>

<h2>3. Data Analysis</h2>
<h2>Part III: Write-up</h2>
<ul>
<li>For Part I, give a short summary of the Lorentz Force and the Right-Hand Rule. </li>
<li>For Part II, write a short paragraph describing the procedure taken and any important observations for each Exercise. Be sure to summarize your results and reasons why you believe your data are precise and accurate. If you do not think your data are accurate, explain why, and how it could be fixed in a future lab.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to attach images of your plots,  data, and setup -- doing so may allow you to regain partial or full credit even if your experiment fails.</li>
<li>At the end of your write-up, please include the answers to all questions, clearly numbered. Show your work if applicable.</li>
