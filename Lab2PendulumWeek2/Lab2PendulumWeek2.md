<!---[INSERT ANIMATED GIF HERE]--->


In this experiment you will be using your phone to measure the acceleration in the x, y, and z axes without gravity. You will build an apparatus and take data. Include a picture of your setup if you can!

While you may be able to achieve a pendulum without them, we recommend using the additional materials as well. This guide will assume that you have them.

1. Find the cardboard tube from a toilet paper roll and flatten it.

2. Mark the width of your phone on both sides of the flattened tube.
<!---:::Figure:Figure![Suggested Materials](imgs/IMG_0712.jpg):::--->

3. Make a cut, approximately 4 mm deep, at each mark you made with your phone. Cut from one mark to the other, along the length of the roll, to complete the cutout. Do this on both sides.

:::Figure:Figure

4. Poke holes in each of the corners of the flattened roll, leaving enough space along the edge that you don’t rip out to the edge.

5.  Now cut a long length of string. Make sure you leave a lot of slack, too. This string will run through the width edge, run underneath the roll, then back through and up the other width edge hole.

:::Figure:Figure

6.  Insert your phone into the whole you have cut, with the string ends on the same side as your phone face. Put a rubber band, or something else elastic, around one end of the phone (while the roll is at that end). Slide the roll and elastic band to the other side, so you can fir it around there too. This will secure your phone even more.

# Part IV: Experiment

##### Background
A period is the time it takes for one cycle in a repeating event or the time for which the event repeats itself. 
#####
A pendulum at rest is considered to be in equilibrium. Once the pendulum is displaced, it oscillates about the equilibrium position. The duration of time from the position of displacement after it is released and back to that position is the period of the pendulum.
#####
You should have determined by now how you will be turning your phone into a pendulum.
#####
Typically, when measuring the period of the pendulum, you would measure the angular position as a function of time. Then from those data you would calculate the period of the pendulum. 
##### 
(very rough) Did you know that the clock was invented after the discovery of Simple Harmonic Motion? Simple Harmonic Motion also is how musicians keep time with one another.
#####


:::Exercise
In this exercise you will measure the length of your pendulum. This would be straight forward in lab, but since we don't have access to a lab it might be a bit more complicated. Below are some tips and ideas to help you accomplish this task.

Figure 13 below shows a front view and a side view of your phone in the cradle. In the front view the long axis of the phone is coming in and out of the screen, in the side view it is running parallel to the screen.

This distance you want to measure is from the pivot tot he center of mass of the phone. This is depicted as $L$. 

- If you have a measuring tape, use one end at the point of the pivot and then measure straight downward to the center of mass of your phone. 

- If you do not have a measuring tape but have a ruler, cut a piece of string that you will dangle from the surface of the pivot to your phone in a straight downward line. Then use a ruler to measure the length of that string.
- If you don't have a ruler of any sort then we recommend using lined paper. You can look up the spacing for different types of rulings.


You are free to use either of those methods. However, if you have access to neither of those methods, or another method of your choosing, then we will have to use trigonometry to solve this problem. 
#####
First, we suggest that you keep your string lengths perpendicular to the floor, i.e. from the front view, you do not want them flaring out or in, but rather straight up. This will make things a little easier. Secondly, you will need to measure $l$ and then use the Pythagorean to calculate the length $L$.
:::Note
Please note; if you *are* using a measuring device of some kind make sure the resolution of the measurement is appropriate.
:::
1. Measure the length of your pendulum in meters.
#####
:::Figure:Figure
![Suggested Materials](imgs/diagram.png)
:::

:::Question
a) What tool did you use to measure the length of your pendulum?

b) Briefly write a short description of the procedure you used to measure the length.
:::

:::Question
What is the length of you pendulum in meters. Be sure to include the uncertainty in your measurement. **Hint:** If you forgot how to get uncertainty from a scale the information is contained in Lab $0$.
:::

:::


::: Exercise

In this exercise you will use Phyphox to collect acceleration data from you phone while it is swinging.


1. Look up the mass of your phone online. Record the value in your table. Make sure to use the correct units. 
3. Using the "Accelerometer **without** g" experiment and tap ⋮ to go to "Timed Run". Chose an appropriate start delay (first blank) and experiment duration (second blank & about 15-20 secounds). Now, when you hit play, the phone will wait the set amount of time to start collecting data and then only collect data for the time you set. This will allow you get a nice run of data and not have to do any trimming later.

:::Figure:Figure
![Screenshot of Timed Run](imgs/TimedRun.jpg)
:::

5. Displace the phone by a small amount (something like $15^{\circ}$), hit play, and then release your phone.
6. Let it swing for the time you set in Step 3 and then look at your data. 
7. Ensure that the data looks good (see notes below), and that you have 10 or more periods.

:::Note
"Good" data is hard to define. You might just try taking a couple runs to see what type of data comes out. You should however be able to make *some* predictions about what good data should look like.

Recall that $a_\theta$ should look like $\cos(\Omega t)$ while $a_r$ should look like $\sin^2 (\Omega t)$. Thus you should hope to see things like $a_r$ has half roughly the period of $a_{\theta}$. You should notice that $a_{\theta}$ oscillates about $0$ while $a_r$ is almost entirely positive. Your final axis shouldn't have much on it). It is unlikely that you will get perfect data (i.e. exact cosine and sine squared functions), but should see these sort of trends.
:::

:::Note
Pay attention to the vertical axis scaling on your three plots. They won't all be the same so you shouldn't directly compare your three graphs to each other without first rescaling or noting the difference in scales.
:::

# Part V: Data Analysis 
<!---ex 2 get everyone's data, plot it, do a power fit. check that it matches theory-->

:::Exercise
We want to determine the period, $T$, of the oscillations of motion. We will do so by looking at the oscillatory behavior of the accelerations recorded by the phone in the three different directions. Remember your derivations from Week 1 to determine the relationship between the periods of the accelerations in the different directions and the period  $T$ of motion of the pendulum.

:::Question

a) How do the periods of the accelerations measured by the phone compare to the period of oscillations of the pendulum?

b) Which axis has the same period as the period of motion?
:::

1. Find the period of motion of the pendulum by measuring the average period of the acceleration with the same period as the period of motion (your answer from the previous question). 
To find the average period, measure the time it takes the pendulum to complete 10 periods and divide by the number of periods (in this case 10). This will reduce the error in your measurement. If your data only displays 8 or 9 periods , that works as well.

:::Figure:Figure
![How to measure period in phyphox](imgs/PeriodMeasurement.gif)
:::

:::Question
What is the average period of motion? For now, include 4 decimal places in your measurement.
:::


Remember the period $T$ is determined by the length of the pendulum $L$ and the acceleration due to gravity $g$. 

:::Figure:Equation
$$T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
:::

3. Rewrite the Equation 1 to find $g$ in terms of $L$ and $T$.
2. Given your value of $L$ measured earlier and of $T$ which you found from the acceleration data, determine the value of $g$.
3. Find the percent discrepancy between the value you found for $g$ and the accepted value of $9.806 m/s^2$.

:::Question
a) What is the value of $g$ from your measurements? Don't worry about uncertainty.

b) What is the percent discrepancy you recorded?
:::
:::

#### Propagation of Uncertainty

In the last exercise you calculated a value for $g$ using your one data measurement. Up until this point in Physics 3L when we have discussed uncertainty we either determined it from a scale or from a standard deviation. 

A standard deviation requires multiple measurements of the same value, but you currently only have one measurement. How does one report uncertainty in that measurement? Well, if we know the uncertainty in the values that make up the measurement we care about we can **propagate** those uncertainties to measurement we care about. For this experiment, if we know the uncertainties in $T$ and $L$ we can **propogate** them to $g$ to calculate the uncertainty in $g$.

Propagating uncertainty can get complicated and we won't provide the techniques in this lab, but we will provide the formula for how to calculate the uncertainty in $g$. In the equation below the uncertainties are denoted with a $\delta$ before the variable and the best estimation is just the variable (i.e. $\delta L$ is the uncertainty in the length $L$)

:::Figure:Equation
$$
\delta g = g \sqrt{\left ( \frac{\delta L}{L}\right)^2 + \left ( \frac{2\delta T}{T}\right )}
$$
:::

:::Note
In the equation above $L$, $g$, and $T$ are all the measured values.
:::

:::Exercise
In this exercise you will **propagate the uncertainty** in $L$ and $T$ to determine the uncertainty in $g$.

1. First we must determine the uncertainty in $T$. To do this look at your accelerometer data from the "Lab 0: Intro to Phyphox" lab. 
2. Open the spreadsheet and look at the time column. In a separate column take the difference between one time value and the one before it.

:::


In the last exercise you demonstrated how the period of the pendulum relates to its length. Hopefully you saw that a power law fit matches pretty well with the theory we developed last week. Determining the quality of a non-linear curve fit quantitatively can be very challenging and is beyond this class.

It is possible, though, to analyze a **linear** fit quantitatively. There are some semi-complicated equations that tell use what the uncertainty in the slope and intercept is for a linear fit. We won't worry about the details of those here but we will just use google sheets' "LINEST" function. 

LINEST is short for Linear Estimation. It will use the method of least squares to make a best estimation of the line that fits your data.

Below is a video that shows you how use the LINEST function in Google Sheets and how to get the slope, the uncertainty in the slope, the intercept, and the error in the intercept.

:::Exercise

In this exercise you will be submitting your data in a Google form that will be collected into one larger dataset with all the students in your class. We will then **linearize** the class data so that we can fit a line to the data and make a quantitative judgment about the experiment.Submit you data in the form linked in the table below. Make sure the mass you provide is in **kilograms**, the length is in **meters**, and the period is in **seconds**. **Also make sure that you select your correct section!**

::: Note
Wait until your TA gives you to okay to proceed. You'll need enough data collected to make a usable set of data. 
:::

To linearize an equation you must perform a mathematical operation on your equation so that the independent variable is linear. That is, it appears once and is to the first power. While performing the linearization to the independent variable you track the mathematical operations done to the dependent variable. You then apply those to the operations to the dependent variable to generate a new equation that is linear. 

For this lab, $L$ is your independent variable and $T$ is your dependent variable. If you square both sides of Equation 1 you will have a function, $T^2$ that is linear in $L$.

:::Question
Linearize Equation 1. What is the new equation?
:::

1. Make a new column in you spreadsheet. In this column square each of the period measurements. 
2. Create a new plot  of $T^2$ vs $L$.
3. Add a linear trendline and use the LINEST function to get the uncertainties for the slope an intercept.

:::Question
a) What is the value of the slope? Make sure to include the units and uncertainty.

b) Based on your response in Question 7, what should the slope be?
:::

:::Question
Use the slope to determine a value for $g$.
:::

Determining the uncertainty in $g$ is slightly more complex then just using the uncertainty in the slope provided by LINEST. Because the slope is exactly equal $g$ the uncertainties aren't exactly equal either. To determine the uncertainty you must **propgate** it from $m$ to $g$. This is another topic that we will save the details for later, but for now we will just state that the uncertainty in $g$, denoted $\delta g$ is related to the uncertainty in the slope $\delta m$ in the following way:

:::Figure:Equation
$$
\delta g = |g| \left(\frac{\delta m}{|m|}\right)
$$
:::

:::Question
a) What is the value you measured for $g$ with the uncertainty?

b) Does the accepted value of $g$ fall within your window of uncertainty?

c) Does this strengthen the theory? Why or why not?
:::

5. Find the percent discrepancy between the value you found for $g$ and the accepted value of $9.806 m/s^2$.
:::Question
What is the value of $g$ and the percent discrepancy you recorded?
:::
:::

:::Exercise
1 . In this experiment we used small angles in order to capitalize on the small angle formula. This allowed us to bypass many more advanced mathematics and study simple harmonic motion.
We also never varied the mass of the pendulum. Even though you only took data for one initial angular displacement and one mass, answer the following questions using your intuition.
:::Question
a. Does the period significantly depend on the mass? Why? Justify your answer.
b. Based on the average of one period, what is g?
:::  

:::

<!---ex 3 linearize it. show linest video. "this is your error now, on your slope", translate it into error in g. how does that value compare to your known g?--->
