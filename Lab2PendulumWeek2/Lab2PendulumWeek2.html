<div class="Note"><p>DISCLAIMER - You will be using your phone to take data, and this can sometimes lead to accidents. <strong>Please use due care in handling your phone during this experiment.</strong></p></div>
<p>In this experiment you will be using your phone to measure the acceleration in the x, y, and z axes without gravity. You will build an apparatus and take data. Include a picture of your setup if you can!</p>
<p>While you may be able to achieve a pendulum without them, we recommend using the additional materials as well. This guide will assume that you have them.</p>

<li>
<p>Find the cardboard tube from a toilet paper roll and flatten it.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark the width of your phone on both sides of the flattened tube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a cut, approximately 4 mm deep, at each mark you made with your phone. Cut from one mark to the other, along the length of the roll, to complete the cutout. Do this on both sides.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Poke holes in each of the corners of the flattened roll, leaving enough space along the edge that you don’t rip out to the edge.</li>

<ol start="5">
<li>Now cut a long length of string. Make sure you leave a lot of slack, too. This string will run through the width edge, run underneath the roll, then back through and up the other width edge hole.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="Figure"><p><img src="imgs/IMG_0727.jpg" alt="Suggested Materials"></p><figcaption>Figure 7</figcaption></figure>
<ol start="6">
<li>Insert your phone into the whole you have cut, with the string ends on the same side as your phone face. Put a rubber band, or something else elastic, around one end of the phone (while the roll is at that end). Slide the roll and elastic band to the other side, so you can fir it around there too. This will secure your phone even more.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Part IV: Experiment</h1>
<h5>Background</h5>
<p>A period is the time it takes for one cycle in a repeating event or the time for which the event repeats itself. </p>
<h5></h5>
<p>A pendulum at rest is considered to be in equilibrium. Once the pendulum is displaced, it oscillates about the equilibrium position. The duration of time from the position of displacement after it is released and back to that position is the period of the pendulum.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>You should have determined by now how you will be turning your phone into a pendulum.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>Typically, when measuring the period of the pendulum, you would measure the angular position as a function of time. Then from those data you would calculate the period of the pendulum. </p>
<h5></h5>
<p>(very rough) Did you know that the clock was invented after the discovery of Simple Harmonic Motion? Simple Harmonic Motion also is how musicians keep time with one another.</p>

<div class="ExerciseHeading"><p>Exercise 1</p><div class="Exercise parsed"><p>In order to accurately measure the length of your pendulum, we will need to figure a method for determining that. If you have a measuring tape, use it. We could use another string and use that. We could <strong>__</strong>. You are free to use either of those methods. However, using trigonometry will be more accurate in the end and will require a little explanation.</p><h5></h5><p>First, we suggest that you keep your string lengths perpendicular to the floor, i.e. from the front view, you do not want them flaring out or in, but rather straight up. This will make things a little easier. Secondly, you will need to calculate two projections of the length in order to use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the effective length of your pendulum.</p><h5></h5><p>//pictures here</p><h5></h5><p>//diagrams here</p><h5></h5><p>Measure the length of your pendulum. Print a ruler from an online source or use a money. A dollar bill is 6" long and if you need something smaller, a quarter is 1 inch.</p></div></div>
