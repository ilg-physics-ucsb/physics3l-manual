# Course Info
---

Welcome to the Physics 3L Lab course. This is a companion course for the Physics 3 lecture course but it is its own course. Therefore it does not map perfectly to the lecture course. You will see material from early physics lecture course as well as some material covered in Physics 3.

There are two main goals of this course.

1. We want you to see for yourself and verify some of the physical phenomena you've seen in theory.

2. Start process of learning the tools of the trade for experimental physics.

Goal 2 has a lot packed into it. Some of the things we will begin to cover will be the following:

- How to design and build a good experimental apparatus.
- How to apply a theory to an experiment.
- How to verbally, mathematically, and visually present your findings.
- How to quantify the uncertainty in the measurements you make.
- How to make a judgement based on your findings.

You will do all of this by building apparatus, making measurements using your phone, and analyzing the results. Then you will put all of this together to draw a conclusion about your experiment.

# Phyphox

We will be using the [Phyphox](https://phyphox.org/) smartphone application for this quarter.

This application will utilize the sensors in your phone to make measurements of the world around you. Some of the sensors available are:

- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- GPS
- Magnetometer
- Barometer
- Microphone

This is just a sample of the sensors available to you.

:::Note
Not all phones will have access to all the same sensors. Most phones will at least have an accelerometer, microphones, and speakers which is mainly what will be used this quarter.

# Materials
---

We will be using many materials throughout this quarter. If you can, try get the materials ahead of time.

## Tape Measure or Ruler

:::RFigure
![Tape Measure](../imgs/courseinfo/tapemeasure.png)
:::

In this class, you will need to make quite a few length measurements. A few of these lengths will be longer than 1 foot in length. For that reason we recommend getting a tape measure over a ruler, particularly one with a metric ruling. If you can only get a ruler, there are some tricks you can do to make measurements larger than 1 foot.

A recommendation for a tape measure is the [Lufkin 10'/3m](https://www.amazon.com/LUFKIN-L610CMEN-Tape-Power-13Mm/dp/B078Z354J9/ref=sr_1_16?dchild=1&keywords=tape+measure+lufkin+metric&qid=1609360095&s=hi&sr=1-16) tape measure.

## Bouncy Balls

:::RFigure

:::

For one of the labs you will need two types of bouncy balls. You will need anything that can bouncy at least 5 times when dropped from around 1 m high.

Some options outside of the ones pictured here are:

- Tennis Balls
- Ping Pong Balls
- Basketball

## String or Wire or Ribbon

:::

This quarter you will be building your own pendulum. In order to do this will need a way to hang your phone. Thus you will need around 15 feet of string. Some examples of things you could potentially use are the following:

- [Cotton String](https://www.amazon.com/Regency-Natural-Cooking-Twine-Cotton/dp/B002NU6HOI/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=cotton+string&qid=1609361715&sr=8-5)
- [Fishing Line](https://www.amazon.com/KATUYSHA-Braided-Abrasion-Resistant-Superline/dp/B07VHH1YC4/ref=sr_1_17_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=fishing+line&qid=1609361909&sr=8-17-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE5WUpHTk8yV1NRREsmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA5NjUwMDMxQ05RRk0ySFJCTFFIJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2ODg3MjkzSDI3NkNBTzQ3MEo3JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)


## Spring

We will need to purchase a spring in order to study simple harmonic motion. We have not yet identified a good spring but we will let you know some acceptable options soon.

## Other Household Items

There are a few other things that you will need but are items typically found around the house. Those include:

- Scissors
- Tape (Recommend [Blue Tape](https://www.amazon.com/ScotchBlue-Painters-Multi-Use-70-Inch-2090-18E/dp/B00004Z4BB/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=blue+painters+tape&qid=1609365021&sr=8-8))
- Empty toilet paper roll
- Empty paper towel roll
- Empty or full paper towel roll
- Rubber bands
- Ziploc sandwich bags.
- Couch cushion/pillows
- Broom

# FAQ

- Is there a final for this class?

    - There is no final for this course.

- What if I can't find $X$ item?

    - Reach out to you TA as soon as possible and we make a plan.

- I can't Phyphox on my phone.

    - Many of the labs have a way you can do the lab without Phyphox. Let your TA know immediately if this is the case for you and we will make a plan.
